Quartz Extension and utilities for true scheduling in Akka

As Viktor Klang points out, 'Perhaps the name "Scheduler" was unfortunate, "Deferer" is probably more indicative of what it does.'

The Akka Scheduler is designed to setup events that happen based on durations from the current moment, but also is executed around a HashedWheelTimer – a potential precision loss for jobs.

The goal here is to provide Akka with a scheduling system that is closer to what one would expect for Cron type jobs – setup long-running ActorSystems that can have certain events kick off by Quartz.

Evolving, subject to change, and not curently for public consumption.


I don't plan on having anything to do with the distributed transaction, persistence, clustering or any other nonsense anytime soon. This is for cron-ey type timing and scheduling.
 
There is the ability in Quartz to pass JobDataMaps around that accrue mutable state across job ticks; we currently do NOT support that to enforce integrity but may expose a deeper actor structure later that gives some ability to work around that, if need arises.

TODO
––––
find a way to replace quartz.properties with typesafe / akka config and merge over
ensure the actorsystem shutdown can shut the scheduler in the extension down
job scheduling
job execution
investigate supporting listeners, with actor hookarounds.
model job as actor in a way that is meaningful
misfires and recovery model - play nice with supervision, deathwatch, etc [docs page 23 - very close to supervision strategy]
